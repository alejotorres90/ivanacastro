<p id="bio">Plastic artist. Argentina, based in Buenos Aires.<br>
    I started Industrial Design studies at the University of Buenos Aires, where I obtained most of my training. In 2015, I began to venture into the plastic arts, studying art management and production at the General Sarmiento University. That same year, I iniciated my series, which I continue until today. Since 2016, I form part of a cultural management group called Nos re vemo, working on scenery, visuals and ambiance design.</p>
